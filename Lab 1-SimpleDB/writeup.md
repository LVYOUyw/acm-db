I just use two types of data structure - Arraylist and Hashmap.

I think the first experiment is not hard. 

The readme.md make this task very clear and it takes me about 7 hours.

I feel confused about the iterator operation. The code don't have a interface like 

iterator.begin() to visit the first element. We just have iterator.next() to visit all the iterators.

So the initialization of the iterator may be a problem.
