I use First In First Out page eviction policy and a nested-loops join. 

I don't have any changes to the API.

It seems that we should not consider the field name when we compare two tupledesc.

I spend 4 days to finish the lab. 

I don't join in the sql contest since my implementation is trivial and slow.
