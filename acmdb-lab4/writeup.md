To estimate the cost of Join, I only use the simplest strategy. For the EQUAL join,  just output the 

min(card1, card2). For the other join type, just output card1 * card2 * 0.5.



To finish the join optimizer, I just implement the pseudo code  given in the readme file.



I spend about 3 days to finish this lab. I think it is not hard if you just implement the simplest 

strategy.
